# Tripleten's 'Around the U.S.' Project

This is the final version of the "Around the US" project of the Software Engineering program at Tripleten. It is a photo sharing site, based on the Figma design (link below). The web page is responsive, and has been designed for both desktop and mobile devices. It was created using HTML, CSS, and modular Javascript - elements are organized into class components (Card class, UserInfo class, etc). Users can upload, like, view, and delete cards with a customized image and caption. Additionally, users can update their profile name and image. API fetch requests are used to interact with project server, so changes made are saved upon reload. Forms are validated using JS class components.
