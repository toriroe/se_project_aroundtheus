# Practicum Around the U.S. Project (Part 4)

This is the sixth project of the Web Development program at Practicum - it is an updated version of the previous Sprint's project and adds validation functionality to the new-card form and edit-profile forms, using Javascript. Additionally, UX has been improved by adding the ability to exit out of the modal boxes by either clicking the overlay or pressing "Esc". It was created using HTML, CSS,and Javascript based on the Figma design layout. The web page is responsive, so it has been designed for both desktop and mobile devices. Photos have been optimized using "TinyPng" (https://tinypng.com/).
