# Practicum Around the U.S. Project (Version 7)

This is the seventh version of the "Around the US" project of the Web Development program at Practicum - it is an updated version of the previous Sprint's project. The main feature added in this iteration includes using API fetch requests to interact with the project server, so that changes made to the page are saved upon reload. Additionally, implemented functionality for the profile avatar so that the image can be updated.
It was created using HTML, CSS,and Javascript based on the Figma design layout. The web page is responsive, so it has been designed for both desktop and mobile devices.
