# Practicum Around the U.S. Project (Part 2)

This is the fourth project of the Web Development program at Practicum - it is an updated version of the third project which includes previous features as well as a modal box for editing profile info, and cards rendered through Javascript rather than static HTML code. It was created using HTML, CSS,and Javascript based on the Figma design layout. The web page is responsive, so it has been designed for both desktop and mobile devices. Photos have been optimized using "TinyPng" (https://tinypng.com/).

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Grid Layout
- Use of media queries so that all elements are displayed properly on different screen resolutions
- Flat BEM
- Use of psuedo-classes to customize hover states for buttons
- Use of Javascript to implement limited interactivity to profile edit modal box (change name and description of profile)
- Card elements and images rendered through Javascript using <template> element

## Plan on improving the project

- Adding increased interactivity, so that users can "like" images, connect site to a server so that changes made to profile and cards are saved upon page refresh.
