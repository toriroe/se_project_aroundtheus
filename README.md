# Practicum Around the U.S. Project (Part 3)

This is the fifth project of the Web Development program at Practicum - it is an updated version of the previous Sprint's project and introduces a modal box for adding new cards to the page when the "Add" button is clicked on, as well as a popout of a card image that has been clicked on. Additionally, like buttons are functional and change appearance when clicked on. A delete button has been added for the cards, and will remove a card element when clicked on. Finally, modals have smooth opening and closing transitions. It was created using HTML, CSS,and Javascript based on the Figma design layout. The web page is responsive, so it has been designed for both desktop and mobile devices. Photos have been optimized using "TinyPng" (https://tinypng.com/).
