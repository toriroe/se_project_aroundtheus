# Practicum Around the U.S. Project

This is the third project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the Figma design layout. The web page is responsive, so it has been designed for both desktop and mobile devices. Photos have been optimized using "TinyPng" (https://tinypng.com/).

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Grid Layout
- Use of media queries so that all elements are displayed properly on different screen resolutions
- Flat BEM

## Plan on improving the project

- Implemeting interactivity to the site, so users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their own profile.
